# What happened to 'scrawl'?
So it's been almost a year since we released a update on android or push commits on the main branch and there is a good reason for it. Last year, I was a final year college student doing my bachelor's. I wanted to focus on my career in User Experience and so began the revamping of 'scrawl'. We(@suranjum and I) knew that this needed some more attention but due to busy schedules we couldn't focus on it. We also knew that this application needs to be reworked a lot and had a lot of missing features.

## So what's the new features?
Well to start of, 'scrawl' needed an online API service. Why, you ask? Because it was a pain to check our notes which was written on Android app and not being able to use it in desktop. Nextcloud backup was not the solution for this as we just uploaded the encrypted database to your respective nextcloud hosting. There was no background sync and boy it is a pain to use background service without Google services. So we came up with our own API.

> Q) So am i tied up to online notes like other services?\
> A) Nope, you can still use offline notes, without account creation(currently only planned for android and ios)

The next feature was cross platform support and this was already in our plan and we will be first focusing on desktop/web and slowly release on Android and iOS. 

About the releasing in iOS, it is a not easy and no means cheap. We do have the devices to build and test, but the developer license cost a lot (8000/~ INR which is lot for us)(you can look it up on Google) and it is not one time license, it's valid only for a year and we have to renew it every year. This doesn't mean we won't release it, it might take some time until we see some user base. 

There will be new modules coming to the app which will be released one by one, by the end of this year.

## Will there be charges for online services?
Yes and no. The application and service is free of cost but will be charged after the user reaches the maximum quota. Since the user base is low, there won't be any quota.

## There is one more change.....
The application is now known as **scrwaler**. Why you might ask? Well we did not register a domain and we were basically screwed. We had to come up with something else and scrawler seemed to fit the choice. For downloading desktop application, they will be released on Github releases for now and for web, the application is live on [scrawler.net](http://scrawler.net).

## Why do I have create account for this?
I know some people hate the idea of remembering passwords but since privacy and security is one important feature we strive it is best to not use OTP(One Time Password) of sorts. 

## I don't see Nextcloud backup. WHY!?
We are solely focusing on online service for now and don't worry we will add Nextcloud module back. It will be definitely be available for offline user who don't want to opt online service.
